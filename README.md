Evolving-Plants-2.0
===================
What is this?
-------------
An update to my last evolving plants simulation, this one is uses simple character defined genetics to build a fixed shape plant, 
with a small simple set of instructions, allowing the ability to easily create your own genetic masterpieces. The lighting is improved
to allow plants to monopolise specific colour ranges and is still much quicker allowing for vast side scrolling simulations and
personalised regions of shade, The interface now uses my new TComponents and TCode libraries, making the background processes smoother
and more responsive than ever.

How do I run the program?
-------------------------
You can [download a runnable.jar here](https://github.com/SebastianTroy/Evolving-Plants-2.0/raw/master/Evolving%20Plants%202.0/Evolving%20Plants%202.0.jar)
If it doesn't run when you double click on it, first try installing the latest version of java, if you are still
having problems you can [download the windows launcher here] and run that from from the same directory as the .jar.
